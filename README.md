### 🚗 [**Car Insurance Claim Prediction with XGBoost @ EchoPlus AI**](https://github.com/Feiyingdai/Car-Insurance-Claim-Prediction)

This project develops an XGBoost-based predictive model to identify high-risk drivers who are likely to file car insurance claims. The model leverages domain-specific features from driver demographics, vehicle details, regional conditions, and driving behavior.

#### 🎯 Objectives:
Predict whether a driver will make a claim (binary classification), enabling data-driven risk stratification and personalized insurance management.

#### 💼 Business Applications:

💰 Risk-based Premium Adjustment
Adjust insurance pricing based on predicted claim probabilities

🛡️ Tailored Underwriting Rules
Define acceptance thresholds or policy conditions based on risk profiles

🚘 Proactive Behavioral Interventions
Identify high-risk drivers early and offer training, incentives, or personalized feedback to reduce claim likelihood
